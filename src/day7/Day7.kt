/* # Day 7: Internet Protocol Version 7
 *
 * An IP supports TLS if it has an Autonomous Bridge Bypass Annotation, or ABBA.
 * An ABBA is any four-character sequence which consists of a pair of two different
 * characters followed by the reverse of that pair, such as xyyx or abba. However,
 * the IP also must not have an ABBA within any hypernet sequences,
 * which are contained by square brackets.
